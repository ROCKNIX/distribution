Change Log

     * Adds support for the Anbernic RG503! There are still a few known
       issues, but JELOS support is now considered stable enough to
       release.
          + Known Issues: Device boots when plugged in to charge.
            WireGuard is not functional. Controls in movie player are not
            working quite right yet.
     * Adds moonlight to the main distribution and integrates it within
       the ES menu. To get started, press start, select Moonlight Game
       Streaming from the menu and enter all of the information about your
       moonlight service.
     * Adds support for Jaguar emulation. This emulator is known to only
       work well on the RG552, but it is available across devices.
     * A second theme is now available by default, you're able to choose
       between Artbook Next (system-theme) and Minimal.
     * A new CPU governor (interactive) has been selected by default
       replacing on demand. This governor reduces latency and should help
       improve performance across cores and emulators.
     * The ability to choose your desired CPU governor is now available in
       ES to replace the Max Performance setting. You are able to
       configure Interactive, Ondemand, or Performance per game, per
       system, or globally.

Powkiddy x55 - READ ME BEFORE UPDATING

With JELOS version 20220527 we introduced a fix that corrected an issue
with the device powering on and booting when it was connected to a
charger. If you've already re-flashed your x55 with 20220527, you can
ignore this section.

This fix changes how the device boots and cannot be mitigated by an
update alone. The JELOS team recommends that you re-flash your device.
If you have updated and you're here because you have a black screen and
the device will not boot - you're in luck because manual recovery is
pretty easy.

Manual Recovery Steps

     * Eject the microsd and insert it into a Window/Linux/Mac PC.
     * Open /extlinux/extlinux.conf with a text editor like Visual Studio
       Code.
     * Change: FDTDIR / to FDT /rk3566-evb2-lp4x-v10-linux.dtb
     * Save and eject the card.
     * Insert the card in your x55, and it should power on normally.
     * Enter the System Settings Menu in ES.
     * Enable FORCE NEXT UPDATE.
     * Back out of the menu to save.
     * Re-enter System Settings, and select START UPDATE.

20231201 -

New Features

     * The JELOS team is happy to announce support for merged storage!
       This change merges your internal or tf1 microsd storage with your
       external microsd to allow both devices to be used as game storage!
          + Requires the microsd card to be formatted as ext4, the feature
            is automatically disabled when ExFAT and FAT are used as those
            filesystems are not compatible.
          + We now have a new directory structure for games:
               o Internal Storage (or tf1): /storage/games-internal
               o External MicroSD (or tf2): /storage/games-external
               o Combined Path: /storage/roms
          + Games and data copied to /storage/roms will be saved to
            /storage/games-internal.
          + Samba has been updated to present both volumes for network
            access.
          + EmulationStation now has an eject option under System Settings
            -> Hardware /Storage that is available when merged storage is
            active.
          + When a compatible microsd is inserted, JELOS will
            automatically add it to the overlay if merged storage is
            active, making the content available to ES after a gamelist
            update or an ES restart.
          + The udevil service will no longer mount microsd cards to
            /run/media, however it will still handle mounting all other
            external storage.
          + After the update, JELOS will automatically migrate your
            current roms directory to /storage/games-internal once.
          + A new function is available in System Settings to disable
            merged storage, please disable before copying files into the
            games folders.
          + The rom split tool is now deprecated as it is no longer
            needed.
     * Adds saving for TWB64 and Pixelshift Gambatte palettes, thanks to
       [121]@GlazedBelmont!
     * JELOS now supports AptX and AptX-LL Bluetooth audio using supported

     * Update Linux to 6.6.3 and 6.1.4, Mesa updated to 23.3.0.
     * Anbernic RG552 and RK3326 devices now shift into powersave mode
       before sleep to significantly reduce power consumption while
       sleeping.
     * AMD64 Linux kernel now includes [124]@NeroReflex's optimize harder
       patch for improved optimization.
     * Adds support for Lenovo Legion GO display rotation, thanks to
       [125]@mauroferra!

20231212 -

New Features

     * Adds support for changing the merged storage target between the
       internal and external card.
          + Since JELOS creates the games directory structure it is
            possible that the overlay will hide games if you switch
            targets as it will consider them removed. Delete the empty
            directories and reboot to resolve.
               o Ex: find /storage/games-internal -type d -empty -delete
                 && find /storage/games-external -type d -empty -delete &&
                 reboot
          + Merged storage can now be disabled persistently.
          + A new directory structure is required to enable switching:
               o /storage/games-internal/roms
               o /storage/games-external/roms
               o The target /storage/roms has not changed.
               o Games will be migrated automatically when possible.
               o If game directories are not created correctly, ssh into
                 the device and run systemd-tmpfiles --create
                 /usr/config/system-dirs.conf.
     * Lowers RK3566 device clocks when put to sleep.
     * Adds ATSC acceleration and CPU accuracy options to Yuzu.

     * JELOS now uses Xwayland and has deprecated xorg-server.
     * Updates Portmaster, Citra-SA, Flycast-SA, Yuzu-SA, Cemu-SA,
       Gambatte-LR, and the Linux kernel to 6.1.65 and 6.6.5 on supported
       devices.
     * Check if the controller is registered and 8bitdo and force
       360-behavior in mednafen, thanks to [122]@sydarn!

20231214 -

Updates

     * Linux kernel 6.6.6 (AMD64).
     * Update emulators, cores, emulation support packages, and system
       theme.
     * Enable serial console output on RK3326, thanks to [121]@royger!
     * Switch default suspend mode to mem + s2idle on RK3566 devices.

Bug Fixes

     * Corrects an issue with merged storage preventing EmulationStation
       from enabling the menu options.
     * Fixes an issue with system directory creation and switches the
       function from automatic to an option in System Settings that
       creates them on demand. This resolves a conflict condition that can
       hide games as duplicate directories may exist before the overlay is
       initialized. See previous release notes (20231212) as a fix is
       provided for affected users.

     Note: For the 'CREATE GAME DIRECTORIES' to work correctly, users
     will need to create /storage/games-internal/roms or
     /storage/games-external/roms manually. This issue will be corrected
     in the next release.
